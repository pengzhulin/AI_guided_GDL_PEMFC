## Abstract
Rational design of gas diffusion layers (GDL) is an example of a long-standing pursuit to increase the power density and reduce the cost of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC). However, current state-of-the-art GDLs are designed by trial-and-error, which is a time-consuming endeavor. Here, we propose a closed-loop workflow of Bayesian machine learning approach to guide the design of GDL structures. With artificial neural network accelerating the calculation of anisotropic transport properties of reconstructed GDLs, Bayesian optimization algorithm identifies optimal structures in only 40 steps, maximizing the PEMFCâ€™s limiting current density. Results suggest that the optimal GDL structure consists of highly orientated fibers with moderate diameters, which is successfully fabricated with a controlled electrospinning technique. Impressively, the PEMFC demonstrates a record high power density of 2.17 W cm-2 and a limiting current density of ~7200 mA cm-2, far exceeding that with commercial GDL (1.33 W cm-2 and ~2700 mA cm-2).
